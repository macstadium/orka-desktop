# Orka Desktop Overview
**Orka Desktop** is a free, no obligation, virtualization tool, which is designed to be deployed on individual macOS workstations. These workstations might be a local Macbook, a hosted Mac mini or Studio by MacStadium, AWS, or even an individual On-Prem solution. Once deployed, **Orka Desktop** allows users to create a seamless workflow for running the same image on any device. An image can be built and tested locally, then uploaded to the cloud. This is much easier than needing bespoke technologies, and individual processes to test, share, and configure virtualized images.

**Orka Desktop** integrates with other cloud based, licensed MacStadium products, like Orka. For example, an image built and tested with Orka Desktop can be uploaded to an **Orka** cloud instance, using this integrated tool. The ability to publish local images to the Orka cloud means users can develop locally and deploy globally - offering flexibility, scalability, and an on-ramp to use MacStadium products more effectively.
